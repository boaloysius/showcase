SHOWCASE is a project which provide a platform to share and comment images.It is completely written in Object Oriented PHP,CSS,HTML,JS.
We have followed good practices like system specific adaption (use of 'DS' and reference of objects with respect to system root) of webpage.
It also provide mail alert to the admin on receiving comments using PHP mailer.We tried our level best to keep DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) practice.

This project was developed during my course "PHP Beyond The Basics" from Lynda.com.
